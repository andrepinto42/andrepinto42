### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is AndrÃ© Pinto and I am currently studying Software Engineering @ [Universidade do Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN)!

My greatest _Passion_ is developing games using the Unity Game Engine and hope someday I work fulltime on creating my own Games.

Have been greatly focused in learning the use of the framework and creating some of my own games for about **2 years**

Here you can checkout some projects that I have been working on:

* [Pokemon Arceus Clone](https://github.com/andrepinto42/Pokemon3)
* [Basic 3D Movement Scripts](https://github.com/andrepinto42/Unity3D-MovementMechanic)

Some others projects have been built but were _nothing serious_...
